= Chronicle Maven Anatomy

(last updated Feb 2021)

The various Chronicle libraries depends on each other in order to reuse common functionality.

== Simplified open-source anatomy
The simplified, one-level-depth, "anatomy" of some open-source Maven dependencies is illustrated here:

_Figure 1: Simplified anatomy._

== Full depth open-source anatomy

The full depth of the open-source Maven dependency tree yields a more complex anatomy as depicted here:

== Source
The graphs above were obtained by running `mvn dependency:tree | grep compile | grep net.openhft` in the open-source libraries above and feeding information into a `.dot` file, for example:

[source, text]

digraph G {

    Queue -> Bytes ;
    Queue -> Wire ;
    Queue -> Compiler ;
    Queue -> Threads ;
    Queue -> Affinity ;

The `.dot` file was then rendered using the online tool https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/
