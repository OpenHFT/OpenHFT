= Chronicle Maven Anatomy
Per Miborg

The various Chronicle libraries depends on each other in order to reuse common functionality.

== Simplified open-source anatomy
The simplified, one-level-depth, "anatomy" of some open-source Maven dependencies is illustrated hereunder:

_Figure 1: Simplified anatomy._

== Full depth open-source anatomy

Regarding the full depth of the open-source Maven dependency tree yields a more complex anatomy illustrated hereunder:

== Source
The graphs above were obtained by running `mvn dependency:tree | grep compile | grep net.openhft` in the open-source libraries above and feeding information into a `.dot` file, for example:

digraph G {

    Queue -> Bytes ;
    Queue -> Wire ;

The `.dot` file was then rendered using the online tool https://dreampuf.github.io/GraphvizOnline/
