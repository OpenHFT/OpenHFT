= Chronicle Overview

Chronicle Software provides libraries to help with fast data. The majority of our customers are in financial services. Our products include:

**link:https://chronicle.software/fix-engine/[Chronicle FIX/ITCH Engine]** - Low latency FIX/ITCH engine in Java for all versions of FIX. Can parse and generate messages within 1 microsecond.

**link:https://chronicle.software/services/[Chronicle Microservices Framework]** - Microservices built with Chronicle Services are efficient, easy to build, test, and maintain. Equally importantly they provide exceptional high-throughput, low latency, and transparent HA/DR.

**link:https://chronicle.software/matching-engine/[Chronicle Matching Engine]** - forms the backbone for a resilient and scalable exchange solution. It provides order matching, validation, and risk checks with high capacity and low latency. It has a modular and flexible design which enables it to be used stand-alone, or seamlessly integrated with Chronicle FIX and Chronicle Services.

**link:https://chronicle.software/efx/[Chronicle EFX]** - built on Chronicle Microservices, EFX contains components for Aggregation, Pricing, Hedging, Position Keeping, P&L, Market Gateway and Algo containers. EFX allows the customer to use off the shelf functionality built and maintained by Chronicle, or to extend and customise with their own algos and IP - the best compromise of "buy vs build".

**link:https://chronicle.software/queue/[Chronicle Queue]** and also link:https://chronicle.software/queue-enterprise/[Chronicle Queue Enterprise] - using Chronicle Queue for low latency message passing provides an effectively unlimited buffer between producers and consumers and a complete audit trail of every message sent. Queue Enterprise provides even lower latencies and additional delivery semantics - for example - only process a message once it is guaranteed replicated to another host(s).

**link:https://chronicle.software/map/[Chronicle Map]** is a key-value store sharing persisted memory between processes, either on the same server or across networks. CM is designed to store the data off-heap, which means it minimizes the heap usage and garbage collection allowing the data to be stored with sub-microsecond latency. CM is structured key-value store able to support exceptionally high updates and high throughput data e.g. OPRA Market Data with minimum configuration. Replication is provided by Chronicle Map Enterprise
